    "synopsis": "After the brutal events of Season 1, Thorfinn has lost his purpose in life following Askeladd’s death. No longer driven by revenge, he becomes a slave on Ketil’s farm, where he meets Einar — another slave who has suffered from war. Together, they work toward earning their freedom, while Thorfinn slowly confronts his inner demons and the meaning of true peace. Meanwhile, political tension rises across Denmark as King Canute pursues his dream of creating a utopia — even if it means using violence once again.",
